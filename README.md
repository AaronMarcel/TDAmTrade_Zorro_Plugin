## Overview
TDAmTrade is a broker plug-in for Zorro, allowing the Zorro trading engine to communicate with TD Ameritrade through the TD Ameritrade REST API. This plug-in is free for non-commercial use&ast;. With it, you can use Zorro to automatically trade stocks, ETFs and options with a TD Ameritrade brokerage account.

**Please note that you cannot trade indices (except through ETFs), futures, future options, or currency pairs (Forex) using this plug-in. The TD Ameritrade API does not allow for the trading of these instruments at the present time.**

For information about getting started with this TD Ameritrade broker plug-in for Zorro, please see [the Wiki Documentation](https://github.com/cwford/TDAmTrade_Zorro_Plugin/wiki).
